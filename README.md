## Financial Complaints Dashboard (Power BI)
The dataset represents financial customer complaints collected by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) between 2017 and 2023.
It includes detailed information about the product type, issue category, company response, submission channel, and customer location.

The analysis focuses on identifying the most common financial issues, products with the highest complaint rates, and evaluating companies’ response efficiency.
The main goal is to provide insights that help improve customer experience, service quality, and decision-making in the financial sector.
